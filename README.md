# Basic Calculator

## Project Overview

A calculator web application that is built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript that is used to test my ability in DOM manipuation. This website demonstrates my ability to build an interactive, responsive, and modern web design.

You can view the live website [here](https://mido-kun.github.io/Basic-Calculator/).

## Main Objectives

The main objectives of this project were to:

- Apply DOM manipulation techniques to create a dynamic web application.
- Implement basic arithmetic operations on the web application.

## What I've Learned

During the development of this project, I learned:

- How to use getElementById to manipulate elements on a web page.
- How to create a dynamic web application using JavaScript.
- How to perform basic arithmetic operations on a web application.
- How to deploy a static website using GitHub Pages.

Overall, this project provides me a solid foundation in modern web development using DOM Manipulation. The skills and knowledge gained from this project will be useful in future web development projects.
